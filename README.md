# weather-app

Welcome to the weather app.

The purpose of this project was to test retrieving and storing weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This data is display through DOM manipulation, unless the data cannot be retrieved. If there's an error with data retrieval, an error message is displayed with the use of promise error handling.
